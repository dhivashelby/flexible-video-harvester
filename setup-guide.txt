# YouTube Video Downloader - Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up and run the YouTube Video Downloader application. Follow these steps in order.

## STEP 1: Prerequisites Check

Before proceeding, make sure you have the following installed:

### 1.1 Check Node.js and npm
```bash
node -v
npm -v
```
If these commands don't return a version number, install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/

### 1.2 Check Python (required for yt-dlp)
```bash
python --version
# OR on some systems:
python3 --version
```
If not installed:
- Windows: Download from https://www.python.org/downloads/
- macOS: `brew install python3`
- Linux: `sudo apt install python3`

### 1.3 Check pip (Python package manager)
```bash
pip --version
# OR
pip3 --version
```
If not installed:
- Windows: It should come with Python
- macOS: `brew install pip3`
- Linux: `sudo apt install python3-pip`

### 1.4 Check yt-dlp (core dependency for video downloading)
```bash
yt-dlp --version
```
If not installed:
- Windows: `pip install yt-dlp`
- macOS: `brew install yt-dlp` or `pip3 install yt-dlp`
- Linux: `pip3 install yt-dlp`

## STEP 2: Project Setup

### 2.1 Install Frontend Dependencies
```bash
# From the project root directory:
npm install
```

### 2.2 Install Backend Dependencies
```bash
# Navigate to the server directory:
cd server
npm install
```

## STEP 3: Running the Application

### 3.1 Run Both Frontend and Backend Together
```bash
# From the server directory:
npm run dev:all
```

This command will start:
- Backend server on http://localhost:3001
- Frontend application on http://localhost:8080

### 3.2 Alternative: Run Frontend and Backend Separately

If you need to run them separately:

```bash
# For backend (from server directory):
cd server
npm run dev

# For frontend (from project root in a new terminal):
npm run dev
```

## STEP 4: Verify Everything is Working

1. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080
2. Enter a YouTube URL in the input field
3. Click "Analyze Video"
4. Select a format and download

## Troubleshooting

### If yt-dlp is not working:
- Try updating it: `pip install -U yt-dlp` or `pip3 install -U yt-dlp`
- Make sure it's in your system PATH

### If you get "command not found" for yt-dlp:
- Windows: Try reinstalling with `pip install --force-reinstall yt-dlp`
- macOS/Linux: Try `which yt-dlp` to find its location, then add to PATH

### If server fails to start:
- Check if port 3001 is already in use: `lsof -i :3001` (macOS/Linux) or `netstat -ano | findstr :3001` (Windows)
- Kill the process using that port if needed

### If the frontend cannot connect to the backend:
- Ensure backend is running
- Check for CORS errors in browser console
- Verify the API URL in the frontend config
